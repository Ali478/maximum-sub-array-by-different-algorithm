Your first job is to convert the algorithms in working C++ code by providing the definition of four functions in the and prepare a detailed report of average  running time of each for n = 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000. Remember that average running time can be computed by running the algorithm on several problems of same size. 


Your second task is to create a similar code for sorting problem providing definition of Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge and Quick sort algorithms.
